In the end, I had final round interviews with two companies. One asked me about whether Java passes objects by value or by reference. Another asked me to do a recursion problem and a parsing challenge. \nI was offered a job at both companies. But I was also convinced that I’d gotten lucky with the interview questions. Every bone in my body thought I needed to make it clear to the companies that I didn’t know what I was doing, the only programming concepts I knew happened to be the ones they asked me! \nI eventually accepted one of the offers and consistently out performed expectations. I was certain I didn’t belong in a developer role, that I didn’t have actual coding skills, but I belonged in that room. And so do you."

    "content": "I quit computer science, my sophomore year of college. I was just totally new to programming, I had just started to learn that year. I had just learned Python, and I thought it was magical. You could type stuff into a computer and something else would come out. You could build all these games and super fun things. Then I took my second class, which was in C++, and I didn’t really understand it. Python has all these things like lists built into them. Why would you ever use C++ because there’s less built into it? You have to write more code to do the same thing, and you have to deal with pointers and all that. I thought that I wasn’t good at it. I was pulling all-nighters. We had to implement a Sudoku solver using backtracking in one of the first weeks of class. And I had no idea what I was doing; it was so hard. I spent so much time on it. On top of that, I felt like a lot of people in the computer science department didn’t look like me. They didn’t have the same interests to me, none of that. And so I felt like I really didn’t fit in. After that semester, I ended up quitting computer science and thought that it wasn’t for me"

Sometimes it is easier to be strong when it is for someone else not yourself.\nIf I am in a place where I already feel like an imposter, I will lean into it big time. One of the few women at a conference... give a talk. Only woman in a meeting... may aswell speak up.  You're already nervous so it can't really get worse so just keep going.\nFor times when it is hard, listen to a chatty podcast where people like you are talking. Make time in your life to go places where you are not an imposter and hold on to that feeling of belonging and inclusion. \nIf you work somewhere that you feel like an imposter, find an ally, work with them to change things so the next person in the door doesn't feel like you do. \nRemember, wherever you end up, you belong."
